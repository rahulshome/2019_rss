This section inspects a lot of the theoretical issues arising out of manipulation task planning. Firstly, the current method shall limit itself to primarily exploring an underlying search structure that consists of a random geometric graph  ( $\mathbb{G}_n^{\mathtt{PRM^*}}$ ) constructed following the $\mathtt{PRM^*}$ \cite{Karaman2011Sampling-based-} regime.
