Efficient solutions to the different variants of the manipulation task planning problems are very pertinent to modern applications. It is desirable to explore the conditions that ensure the properties of asymptotic optimality can be preserved for such algorithms. The introduction of necessary contacts, and mode-transitions at points of low clearance, pose interesting theoretical challenges. The combinatorial aspects of multiple objects and arms pose their own unique challenge, but efficient motion planners in this domain, and algorithmic structures that exist in the context of object rearrangement can be leveraged to guide the search for efficient solutions to manipulation tasks.
