A variety of applications in industrial and service robotics settings require efficient solutions to manipulation tasks. The notion of optimal solutions to these problems must address the nuances of optimal task planning\cite{vega2016asymptotically}. The complexity of the problem in the context of manipulation arises out of multiple typically high-dimensional dexterous arms, a large possible set of grasps, and necessary close contacts. Studying the properties necessary to preserve the asymptotic optimality of the underlying algorithm in the domain of dexterous, prehensile manipulation, the work will also propose efficient algorithms that can yield high-quality solutions quickly.
